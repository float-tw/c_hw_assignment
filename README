C Programming Language Homework
===============================

Hi! This is about your C programming language homework.
Here's some guide for you to do homework.
You may follow it step by step. Cheers.

- Change your **current** directory to your **home directory (~)**

		cd

- Retrieve the homework (including this file)

		git clone /homework

- Change your **current** directory to homework

		cd homework

- Open README (this file) and take a look

		vim README

	In vim, you may exit with typing `:wq` and press enter.

- Change your **current** directory to hw0

		cd hw0

- List files under this directory

		ls

	You will see these files: `hw0.c`, `README`, `REPORT`.
	Take a look at `README` first! I believe you've got it.

- Follow the instructions in `README` and finish your first homework!
