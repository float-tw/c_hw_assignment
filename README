C Programming Language Homework
===============================

Hi! This is about your C programming language homework.
Here's some guide for you to do homework.
You may follow it step by step. Cheers.

First Step
----------

- Change your **current** directory to your **home directory (~)**

		cd

- Retrieve the homework (including this file)

		git clone /homework

- Change your **current** directory to homework

		cd homework

- Open README (this file) and take a look

		vim README

	In vim, you may exit with typing `:wq` and press enter.

- Change your **current** directory to hw0

		cd hw0

- List files under this directory

		ls

	You will see these files: `hw0.c`, `README`, `REPORT`.
	Take a look at `README` first! I believe you've got it.

- Follow the instructions in `README` and finish your first homework!

- When you finish your work, you should...

		git add REPORT
		git commit

	You need to **briefly** decribe what you did this time.
	For example: Finish hw0 REPORT


Future Step
-----------

- Retrieve the homework hw1. You should be in the homework directory first.

		git pull origin hw1

	You will find a new folder named `hw1`.
	Go into `hw1` and follow the `README`!

- To edit the source code, you need vi/vim.

		cd hw1
		vim hw1.c

- When you finish your work, you should...

		git add hw1.c REPORT
		git commit

	You need to **briefly** decribe what you did this time.
	For example: Finish hw1 and the REPORT
